EXAMPLE NOTATION
This document contains a formal definition of the example Notation
using Crater Dog Syntax Notationâ„¢ (CDSN):
 * https://github.com/craterdog/go-grammar-framework/blob/main/v4/Syntax.cdsn

A language syntax consists of a set of rule definitions and token definitions.

The following intrinsic character types are context specific:
 * ANY - Any language specific character.
 * LOWER - Any language specific lowercase character.
 * UPPER - Any language specific uppercase character.
 * DIGIT - Any language specific digit.
 * ESCAPE - Any environment specific escape sequence.
 * CONTROL - Any environment specific (non-printable) control character.
 * EOL - The environment specific end-of-line character.
 * EOF - The environment specific end-of-file marker (pseudo character).

A predicate may be constrained by any of the following cardinalities:
 * predicate{M} - Exactly M instances of the specified predicate.
 * predicate{M..} - M or more instances of the specified predicate.
 * predicate{M..N} - M to N instances of the specified predicate.
 * predicate? - Zero or one instances of the specified predicate.
 * predicate* - Zero or more instances of the specified predicate.
 * predicate+ - One or more instances of the specified predicate.

An inversion "~" within a definition may only be applied to an intrinsic
character type or a glyph range.

RULE DEFINITIONS
The following rules are used by the parser when parsing the stream of tokens
generated by the scanner.  Each rule name begins with an uppercase letter.  The
rule definitions may specify the names of tokens or other rules and are matched
by the parser in the order listed.  A rule definition may also be directly or
indirectly recursive.  The sequence of factors within in a rule definition may
be separated by spaces which are ignored by the parser.
<!
AST: Component EOL* EOF  ! Terminated with an end-of-file marker.

Component: Default | Primitive | List{3..5}

Default: "default"

Primitive:
    character
    text
    integer
    anything

List: "[" Component (',' Component)* "]"

TOKEN DEFINITIONS
The following token definitions are used by the scanner to generate the stream
of tokens that are processed by the parser.  Each token name begins with a
lowercase letter.  Unlike with rule definitions, a token definition cannot
specify the name of a rule within its definition but it can specify the name of
other tokens.  Token definitions cannot be recursive and the scanning of tokens
is NOT greedy.  Any spaces within a token definition are NOT ignored.
<!
character: "'" ~[CONTROL] "'"  ! Any single printable character.

text: '"' (
    ESCAPE
    ~['"' CONTROL]{2..}
)+ '"'

integer:
